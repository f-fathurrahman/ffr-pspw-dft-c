# ffr-pspw-dft-c

`ffr-pspw-dft-c` is a simple program to calculate electronic structure using density functional
theory, plane wave basis set, and norm-conserving pseudopotentials.

It is roughly based on [fhi98md](http://th.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/th/fhi98md/) program.

It is originally written for my master thesis in Program Magister Sains Komputasi, Institut Teknologi Bandung (2010-2012).
